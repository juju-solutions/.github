# About

This organisation houses repositories that support layered charming with the
[charms.reactive][charms.reactive] framework. If these words sound unfamiliar
to you, you probably don't want to build off the code in these repos.

The recommended way to develop charms is described in the [Juju SDK][juju-sdk]
documentation. Reach out to the charming community [on Discourse][discourse]
with any questions.
